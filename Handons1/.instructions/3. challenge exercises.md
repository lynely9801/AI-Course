# Challenge Exercises

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your programming abilities but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks. Even if you're not a developer, you may be surprised how Copilot can help you be successful with these challenge.

<summary>Guided Challenge #1 - Adding Unit Tests - Subtraction</summary>

### Adding Unit Tests

1. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code if it is not already open.

2. Enter ```npm test``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to execute the existing unit tests for the Calculator application.

3. Scroll up in the terminal window to see what tests have been executed. You should see tests for Arithmetic validation, Addition, Multiplication and Division. There are no tests for the subtraction function!

4. Open the ```/test/arithmetic.test.js``` file.

5. Scroll down to the line with the comment ```TODO: Challenge #1``` (Around line 96)

6. On the line following the comment, add a new comment to provide context to GitHub Copilot on what you want assistance to do. Try adding this comment ```// add tests for subtraction``` and press ```ENTER``` to generate a suggestion.

7. Accept the suggested line if it looks right by pressing ```TAB``` then ```ENTER```.

8. Continue accepting suggestions line by line to see how many unit tests you can have Copilot assist you in writing.

9. Once you're happy with a few unit tests, save the file and return to the terminal window. Enter ```npm test``` and press **ENTER** to execute the unit tests again.

10. Let's try Copilot chat to generate the test cases. Open ```api/controller.js``` file. Open Copilot Chat and type ```/tests``` and press **ENTER**.

    >**TIP:** You can use Copilot to generate test cases for your code. Selecting a section of the code or all lines in the file will help with the coverage of suggestions.
